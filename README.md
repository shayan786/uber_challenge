UBER CODE CHALLENGE
===================

*Note, this repository will be deleted within 3 weeks (1/13/2015)*

*Please contact me asap if you need this up for longer then that*

Description / Story
-------------------
This repository repesents one small *'path'* of an entire peer-to-peer marketplace currently deployed as 
[Adventure Local](http://www.advlo.com "Adventure Local")

To summarize (and please feel free to browse the site itself)  [Adventure Local](http://www.advlo.com "Adventure Local") is the quickest, easiest way for adventure travel guides to upload, market, and sell their trips - while connecting directly to a community of global travelers.

This is a startup that I have been working on with 2 others (1 technical, 1 non-technical) which was accepted to an accelerator and is currently self-sustaining with occasional updates / enhancements as we see the demand from the users. 

I am extremely proud of what we have developed for travelers & adventure guides around the world. As an avid traveler and adventure seeker, we felt as if there was a gap in the market of being able to find and connect with locals who provide these off-the-beaten path activities, hence this platform was built over the last 6 months.

Stack / Technologies Used
-------------------------
* Ruby on Rails
* Twitter Bootstrap
* JQuery
* Other inhouse + opensource javascript libraries
* Deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
* DB: Postgresql (Look at db/schema.rb for entire db structure)
* Storage: AWS S3
* Please refer to included Gemfile to see other technologies used in this appication


These technolgies were used since they have been proven to work well with scalability and the community that supports them is large and growing. Also, I had never used RoR before, and this was a great way to learn this framework.

Whats Included & Why
--------------------
For obvious reasons the entire application cannot be made public. However I have included one look into the *Adventure* MVC pipeline. 

This includes:
* Model - with its methods
* Controller
* View (index, show, and various js responses)

About Me

Thanks & Look forward to hearing from you!
